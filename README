This is a PHP web application developed without a framework.
It serves to register participants in aerobatic contests held by the
International Aerobatic Club (IAC).
It was originally written in 2007 or 2008 as a registration system for one
contest, the U.S. National Aerobatic Championships.  The next year it was
extended to support registration for multiple contests.  
It is now used for most of
the IAC Regional aerobatic contests.

With such a specific purpose there's little reason to 
download and install it other than to work on
the code base.  Helpers are welcome.  If you want to add features or make
improvements, by all means contact wbreeze, fork, download, mess around.
